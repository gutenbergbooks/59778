<div class="hangingindent">
<blockquote>

<p><i>The scene is a room just off the &#8220;lounge&#8221; of a hotel
in the country. However, this is not a &#8220;country
hotel;&#8221; but, on the contrary, one of those vast
and elaborate houses of entertainment that affect
an expensive simplicity in what is called the
colonial manner, and ask to be visited&mdash;by those
financially able to do so&mdash;in the general interest
of health and the outdoor life. The wall at the
back of the stage is broken only by symmetrically
spaced pilasters of an ivory color; each of
the side walls is broken in the same manner; but
here the pilasters help to frame two rather
broad entrances, one at the right and one at the
left, and beyond these entrances, on both sides,
we have glimpses of the two corridors that lead
to them. There are a few old prints&mdash;or new
prints from old plates&mdash;upon the walls; and
there are flowering plants on stands in the corners.
The furniture consists of some chintz-covered
easy-chairs, a light wicker settee with
a chintz cushion and a valance that reaches the
floor; and there are two wicker tables with a
vase of jonquils upon each of them. In the rear
right-hand corner of the room, near the stand
of plants, there is a tropical-looking chair,
wicker, with a back of monstrous size&mdash;a Philippine
Island chair&mdash;and in the opposite corner
is its mate.</i></p>

<p><i>Dance music is heard from a distant orchestra.
Just after the rise of the curtain two people
come in together from the left&mdash;a young woman</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<i>of twenty-five, or perhaps she is even a little
older, and a slim boy obviously under twenty.
She is rather elaborate in her afternoon indoor
dress, but none the less effectively pretty; he is
of a scrubbed and sleeked youthfulness, in white
trousers, a short black coat and dancing shoes;
and from the moment of his first appearance
he is seen to be in an extremity of love. He
leans as near the young woman as he can; his
eyes search her face yearningly and without intermission;
he caroms into her slightly as they
come in, and repeats the carom unwittingly.
They have evidently just come from the dancing
floor and are a little flushed; she fans herself
with her handkerchief and he fans her with his.
They are heard talking before they enter: &#8220;Oh,
let&#8217;s do find some place to sit down!&#8221; she is saying;
and he, simultaneously: &#8220;Oh, wasn&#8217;t that
divine! You dance just simply divinely!&#8221;
These speeches &#8220;bring them on.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote></div>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Here&#8217;s a place we can sit down! (<i>She immediately
drops into a chair.</i>)</p>

<p><small>THE BOY</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, this is a lovely place, where nobody is at
all. It&#8217;s the only quiet place in the hotel: you
never see more than two people here at a time,
because it&#8217;s kind of off, like this. That&#8217;s why I
wanted to walk this way. (<i>Sitting on a lounge
and leaning toward her.</i>) Isn&#8217;t it divine to be
in a place where nobody is at <i>all</i>?</p>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small> (<i>still fanning herself</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Why, you and I are here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><small>THE BOY</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes; but I mean nobody else at all. We&#8217;re
practically all alone, practically.</p>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small> (<i>laughing as she waves her
hand to indicate the spacious corridors to the
right and left</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Alone? Why, there are at least three hundred
people in this hotel.</p>

<p><small>THE BOY</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, but they&#8217;re all either outdoors, or dancin&#8217;,
or havin&#8217; tea, right now. It&#8217;s practically the
same as being alone. It is&mdash;practically, I mean.</p>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, I&#8217;ve noticed that it was a rather secluded
spot myself. (<i>She glances about the room
thoughtfully, then turns to him, smiling.</i>) Don&#8217;t
you want to run and dance with some of those
pretty young girls your own age?</p>

<p><small>THE BOY</small> (<i>with pained earnestness</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Them? My goodness, no!</p>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Oh, but that isn&#8217;t normal, is it?</p>

<p><small>THE BOY</small></p>

<p class="p2">I&#8217;m not normal. I don&#8217;t want to be normal.</p>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Well, but it would only be natural for you to
like those pretty young things, so&mdash; Well, <i>do</i>
run and dance with one of &#8217;em. Won&#8217;t you,
please?</p>

<p><small>THE BOY</small> (<i>interrupting</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">No. They haven&#8217;t got any experience of life.
What I like is a woman that&#8217;s had some experience
of life, like you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small></p>

<p class="p2">But at your age&mdash;</p>

<p><small>THE BOY</small></p>

<p class="p2">Age hasn&#8217;t got anything to do with it. The
thing that brings a man and a woman together,
it&#8217;s when they have about the same amount of
experience of life.</p>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small> (<i>absently</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">You think that&#8217;s it, Mr. Briggs? (<i>She looks
about the room thoughtfully as she speaks.</i>)</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>with intense seriousness</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I know it is. I had that feeling the minute I
was introduced to you, night before last in the
lobby&mdash;right by the third column beyond the
office news stand, at a quarter after nine o&#8217;clock
in the evening.</p>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small></p>

<p class="p2">You did?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">It came over me, and I felt kind of&mdash; (<i>he swallows</i>)
kind of drawn to you, Missuz&mdash;Missuz&mdash;Missuz&mdash; (<i>He
seems to hesitate somewhat
emotionally.</i>)</p>

<p><small>THE YOUNG WOMAN</small></p>

<p class="p2">My name is Mrs. Curtis. You seem to have
forgotten it.</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>swallowing again</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I haven&#8217;t. I know it&#8217;s Curtis. The trouble is,
it kind of upsets me to call you <i>Missuz</i> Curtis.
I thought it was Miss Curtis when I was introduced
to you. I didn&#8217;t know your name was
Missuz&mdash;Missuz&mdash;Missuz Curtis till the clerk
told me, early the next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small> (<i>frowning a little</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">The clerk told you?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes. I asked him if he&#8217;d noticed whether you&#8217;d
gone in to breakfast yet. He said, &#8220;You mean
Missuz&mdash;Missuz Curtis?&#8221; Then I knew you
must be married. (<i>He shakes his head ruefully.</i>)</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small> (<i>smiling</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Well?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>thoughtfully</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Well, it can&#8217;t be helped.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">I suppose not.</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>brightening a little</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Well, anyhow, I had that&mdash;that sort of <i>drawn</i>
feeling toward you, the way I <i>would</i> get toward
a woman that&#8217;s had some experience of life;
but a hotel like this is no place to explain feelings
like that. You can&#8217;t when you&#8217;re dancing&mdash;not
the way you want to&mdash;and all the rest of
the time you had some o&#8217; those <i>old</i> men hangin&#8217;
around, or else my mother and sister wanted
me for something; because a hotel like this&mdash;why,
it&#8217;s terrible the way a young man&#8217;s mother
and sister want him to do somep&#8217;n for &#8217;em <i>all</i>
the time; so this is the first chance I&#8217;ve had.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small> (<i>rather urgently</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Don&#8217;t you really think you&#8217;d better be dancing
with some of those young things yonder?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>puzzled</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Think I&#8217;d <i>better</i> be?</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes; I do really wish you would. Wouldn&#8217;t it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
be a lot more fun than explaining something,
as you said, to me?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>hurriedly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">No. No, it wouldn&#8217;t. I want to explain how
I feel about you.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Please go and dance, Mr. Briggs. I think it
would be <i>much</i> better if you&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>rapidly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">No, it wouldn&#8217;t. I want to explain how I feel
about you, so you&#8217;ll understand. It&#8217;s like this,
Missuz (<i>swallowing again</i>) Missuz Curtis. I
never used to think I&#8217;d ever get to feeling this
way about&mdash;about somebody that was married,
but it&mdash;it came over me before I knew you <i>were</i>
married. I already <i>was</i> feeling this way before
he said, &#8220;You mean&mdash;you mean Missuz Curtis?&#8221;
It&#8217;d already&mdash;(<i>he swallows</i>) happened
to me before I knew you were a&mdash;a married
woman. (<i>Shaking his head.</i>) I certainly never
<i>did</i> think I&#8217;d feel this way about a married
woman.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">But I&#8217;m not&mdash;not as you mean it. I&#8217;m a widow,
Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>as in a dim perplexity</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">A wid&mdash; You&#8217;re a widow? (<i>He jumps up
suddenly, greatly amazed.</i>) Oh, my!</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Oh, my!</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">What is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">I guess I&#8217;ve got to get used to the idea of it.
First I thought you weren&#8217;t married, and then
I was just gettin&#8217; used to the idea that you <i>were</i>,
and now&mdash;well, I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s a good deal better,
your bein&#8217; a widow, though, except&mdash;except
for&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Except for?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>hurriedly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean except for your <i>husband</i>! I
didn&#8217;t mean your bein&#8217; a widow was better for&mdash; (<i>He
checks himself and swallows.</i>)</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Oh!</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>frowning with thought</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">No. I meant more on account of the way my
family treats me. My mother and sister&mdash;well,
to tell the truth, they always seem to think I&#8217;m
about four years old. They can&#8217;t seem to <i>realize</i>;
and when I go and tell &#8217;em you&#8217;re a
<i>widow</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">You think they&#8217;ll be interested in hearing it?
I haven&#8217;t even met them.</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">No, but&mdash;but of course they&#8217;ve been <i>talkin&#8217;</i>
about you quite a good deal.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">They have?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">You know how people are in a hotel like this:
wondering who everybody else <i>is</i>, and whether
some woman&#8217;s some old man&#8217;s wife or his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
daughter or just a trained nurse, and all so on.
Of course my family noticed <i>you</i> right away
and then after I <i>met</i> you of course then they
said a <i>lot</i> more about you. Golly! (<i>He shakes
his head, indicating that the comment has been
unfavorable.</i>)</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Oh, indeed!</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>ruefully</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">They watch me like a hawk, and I know what
they&#8217;ll say now! When I tell &#8217;em you&#8217;re a
widow, I mean.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Do you?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>shaking his head</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I certainly never thought myself I would ever
get to feeling this way about a widow <i>either</i>!</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Don&#8217;t you <i>really</i> think you&#8217;d better run and
dance with one of those&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>absently</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">No. (<i>Turning to her suddenly.</i>) I was goin&#8217;
to ask you&mdash;well, of course, in a&mdash;a technical
way, so to speak, I mean in a strickly technical
way, so to speak, I&#8217;m not exactly of age yet, and
I suppose I&#8217;d have to get my mother&#8217;s consent,
because <i>she&#8217;s</i> a widow, too, and got herself appointed
my guardian besides; and the truth is,
she&#8217;s a pretty cold-hearted, bossy kind of a
woman, and it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a big difficulty gettin&#8217;
her to see this thing right.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">To see <i>what</i> right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">The way I feel about you. I know it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
be difficult, because I started to talk a little about
it last night to my mother and my sister&mdash;her
name&#8217;s Jessie&mdash;and they behaved&mdash;well, they
behaved a good deal like two fiends.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">They did?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">I told &#8217;em they didn&#8217;t know you, and they
<i>haven&#8217;t</i> even <i>met</i> you, but they treated me like
a&mdash;like a mere <i>jest</i>; and then they got so critical,
the way they talked about you, it might be
better if they didn&#8217;t see me with you again for
a few days. I can&#8217;t stand the way they talk
after they see me with you.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Indeed!</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Well, what I was saying: I can&#8217;t touch my principal
till I&#8217;m twenty-one on account of the way
my father went and tied up his will; but of

I <i>have</i> got to feeling this way, and I know

this: I know you <i>are</i> a widow and everything

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">I mean I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how you <i>would</i> feel
about gettin&#8217; married again yet, even if I didn&#8217;t
have my own difficulties about it, but&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small> (<i>with increased incredulity</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Are you <i>proposing</i> to me, Mr. Briggs?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Well&mdash;uh&mdash;yes. (<i>Then, looking beyond her
down the corridor on the right.</i>) Oh, goodness.
They watch me like a hawk! Here comes
my mother! (<i>Dismayed, he turns to the left.</i>)</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small> (<i>as he turns</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Perhaps it was time!</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>dismally</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">There&#8217;s my sister Jessie!</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small></p>

<p class="p2">What of it?</p>

<p><small>MR. BRIGGS</small> (<i>hastily</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I told you they behave like two fiends when they
see me with you. (<i>Glancing right and left
nervously.</i>) Well, excuse me. (<i>With perfect
gravity he kneels at one end of the settee, which
is in the rear, a little left of &#8220;center.&#8221;</i>) It&#8217;ll
be a good deal better if they don&#8217;t see me, I expect.
(<i>He promptly crawls under the settee,
and the valance conceals him entirely. From
this invisibility he appeals with pathetic urgency
in a hoarse whisper</i>): They&#8217;ll prob&#8217;ly go right
on. <i>Please</i> wait! Or&mdash;if you <i>haf</i> to go, come
<i>back</i>!</p>

<i>the right. Mrs. Briggs is a handsome woman of
forty-five or fifty, not now in a gracious mood.
She comes in decisively, halts, and stares at Mrs.
Curtis&#8217; back. Then she looks over the room
in an annoyed and puzzled manner. Mr.
Briggs&#8217;s sister Jessie comes in from the left. She
is a pretty girl of about twenty, but her expression
is now rather cross. Her dress and equipment
show that she has just come in from the
golf course.</i>)</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small> (<i>calling as she comes in</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Lancelot! (<i>She halts, puzzled, and looks inquiringly
at her mother.</i>) Mamma, where&#8217;s
Lancelot? I was sure I saw him in here just a
second ago.</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small> (<i>grimly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">So was I. (<i>After looking at each other, they
turn their heads simultaneously and stare at
Mrs. Curtis, who appears to be interested in the

<p><small>JESSIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, very.</p>

<p class="p2">(<i>The two again look at each other, and at a little

once more to look at Mrs. Curtis.</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I beg your pardon, but I&#8217;m under the impression
that you have met my son.</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small> (<i>turning</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Yes?</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, he was.</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Would you be good enough to tell me, did he
leave here to go to his room?</p>

<p><small>MRS. CURTIS</small> (<i>casually</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I don&#8217;t think so; he didn&#8217;t say so. (<i>She gives
them a little nod, smiling politely, and goes out
at the left. They stare after her.</i>)</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small> (<i>still staring after Mrs. Curtis</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">She&#8217;s a very bold type.</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small> (<i>seating herself on the settee</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Very.</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small> (<i>turning to her</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I don&#8217;t see how that little goose got away. You
were coming from that direction and I from
just yonder. I suppose he thought we&#8217;d say
something that would embarrass him before
her.</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">I suppose she&#8217;s thirty-five. I&#8217;ve heard of such
people, but I never saw one before.</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I regard her as distinctly the dangerous type of
adventuress.</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Certainly. In the first place, her not having told
the child frankly that she&#8217;s a widow. One of
the clerks told <i>me</i> she <i>was</i>.</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Oh, she did that to flatter him into believing
he&#8217;s a real grown-up &#8220;man of the world&#8221; having
an &#8220;affair&#8221;!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">So that when he&#8217;s sufficiently entangled she can
tell him she&#8217;s a widow&mdash;and by that time we
don&#8217;t know <i>what</i> he&#8217;d do! A country justice of
the peace probably!</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Last night, when we were trying to teach him
a little common sense about strange people in
hotels, what was it he said she was? &#8220;An
angel!&#8221;&mdash;oh, yes!&mdash;&#8220;One of heaven&#8217;s highest
angels.&#8221;</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small> (<i>grimly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">He said he wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;listen to one of heaven&#8217;s
highest angels gettin&#8217; talked against by a lot o&#8217;
women!&#8221; I&#8217;m sure they heard him in the next
suite. (<i>She rises.</i>) I suppose you&#8217;d better go
and see where he slipped out to, Jessie. Of
course, he&#8217;ll try to find <i>her</i> again as soon as he
can.</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small> (<i>dropping into a chair</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I played three times round the course. Do you
mind if I just sit here a while and rest?</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Then why don&#8217;t you go to your room?</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small> (<i>laughing feebly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I&#8217;m just too tired. I will in a minute. (<i>With
a gesture toward the left entrance.</i>) Hadn&#8217;t
you better&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Keep her in sight? Yes. That&#8217;s easier than
trying to keep <i>him</i> in sight. You&#8217;re going up
to your room right away, aren&#8217;t you?</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, in only a minute. I really think you&#8217;d better
go, Mamma. He might&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">No, I&#8217;ll see to that! (<i>She goes out.</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">(<i>Jessie stares after her for a moment, glances
at a wrist watch, then rises and looks down the
corridor beyond the entrance at the right. She
appears to derive some satisfaction from what
she sees there, returns to her chair and sits in

demure. A moment later a young man&mdash;he is

her alone in the world.</p>

touches her hair, glances right and left, and
uses a diminutive powder puff quickly; then she
closes the box, conceals it in her handkerchief

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small> (<i>rising in some agitation</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Yes, but that was pretty long ago.</p>

<p><small>INGOLDSBY</small> (<i>sharply</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">It was not. I&#8217;ve held my peace in silence all

now. You deliberately broke off with me&mdash;</p>

<p><small>INGOLDSBY</small> (<i>with a suppressed passion</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">You did! (<i>He paces the floor as he goes on.</i>)
You decided Lance Briggs was the better man,

<p class="p2">But you <i>knew</i> why I did it.</p>

<p><small>INGOLDSBY</small> (<i>bitterly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I did indeed! It was simply because you were
of a fickle nature. Of course you didn&#8217;t have
the courage to explain <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small> (<i>with great emotion</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">But you don&#8217;t know the pressure, the awful

was night and day, day and night, week in, week
out&mdash;</p>

<p><small>THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE</small> (<i>continuing heatedly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Why, it&#8217;s your own fault, not mine. I was only
warning you not to go any further. I&#8217;ve heard
enough of other people&#8217;s private affairs for one
afternoon, anyhow.</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small> (<i>in a shaking voice</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Nothing! Nothing at all, Jessie. Why should
you think anything&#8217;s the matter?</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small></p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small> (<i>trying hard to seem lightly amused,
and failing</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Not at all&mdash;not at all! I was just sitting here
a moment with Mr. Ingoldsby, chatting over old

<p><small>INGOLDSBY</small> (<i>checking her sharply</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Miss Briggs, I should not be likely to say anything
disrespectful to my old and dear friend,
your mother. (<i>Looking around angrily.</i>) The
truth is, there&#8217;s an eavesdropping scoundrel concealed
in this room, and I&mdash;</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small> (<i>alarmed</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">What! Oh, I&#8217;m <i>sure</i> there isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p class="p2">I didn&#8217;t! I didn&#8217;t say a <i>word</i>! I <i>was</i> behind

<p class="p2">Lancelot! Oh, gracious me!</p>

<p><small>INGOLDSBY</small> (<i>to Lancelot</i>)</p>

<p><small>RUPERT</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, shame on you!</p>

<p><small>LANCELOT</small> (<i>resentfully</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Well, you <i>would</i> get me; but I&#8217;ll make you sorry
you did it, both of you! (<i>He rises, brushing
himself and adjusting his attire.</i>)</p>

<p><small>LANCELOT</small> (<i>warmly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I was abs&#8217;lootly honorable, because I couldn&#8217;t
help it, and you none of you ever gave me a
single chance to get away. <i>My</i> conduct is the
only one here that hasn&#8217;t got a stain on it or
anything. (<i>He turns hotly upon Mrs. Briggs
and Jessie.</i>) I got nothing to reproach myself
with, but I&#8217;d just like to know what either of
you got to say for yourselves <i>now</i> about the
way you been talkin&#8217; about Mrs. Curtis! If
you either of you ever just <i>dare</i> to soil your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
lips with even her <i>name</i> again, why, I know
more <i>things</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Be quiet, Lancelot.</p>

<p><small>LANCELOT</small></p>

<p class="p2">Quiet? <i>Me?</i> (<i>He laughs shortly with an irony
he could not express in words.</i>) In the first
place, don&#8217;t call me Lancelot any more. You
know how I hate that name, and I been tryin&#8217;
to break you of it long enough&mdash;and now I will!
I don&#8217;t care what you call me, but don&#8217;t call me
<i>that</i>!</p>

<p><small>JESSIE</small> (<i>pointing to the settee</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">How long were you under there?</p>

<p><small>LANCELOT</small> (<i>sternly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Long enough to get mighty tired of hearin&#8217; people
callin&#8217; each other &#8220;Darling&#8221;! Good gracious!
You don&#8217;t think I <i>enjoyed</i> it, do you?
Why, what I heard while I was under there&mdash;well,
I got a pretty strong constitution, but&mdash;</p>

<p><small>MRS. BRIGGS</small></p>

<p class="p2">Hush! Oh, me!</p>

<p><small>INGOLDSBY</small></p>

<p class="p2">The voice that spoke didn&#8217;t sound like Lancelot&#8217;s
voice&mdash;</p>

<p><small>LANCELOT</small> (<i>turning upon him ominously</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Did you hear me say not to call me Lancelot?

<p><small>INGOLDSBY</small> (<i>with hasty meekness</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I&#8217;ll call you anything you like; but I want to

you&mdash;</p>

<p><small>LANCELOT</small> (<i>very emphatically</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">No, it wasn&#8217;t. I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; told you to look
under the settee, would I?</p>

<p><small>INGOLDSBY</small> (<i>with a gesture toward Rupert</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">And this gentleman says it wasn&#8217;t he.</p>

<p><small>RUPERT</small></p>

<p class="p2">Why, it spoke again after I came out.</p>

<p><small>INGOLDSBY</small> (<i>quite bewildered</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">So it did. Then who&mdash;</p>

<p><small>LANCELOT</small></p>

<p class="p2">I don&#8217;t care who it was; what I want to point
out, right here and now, before we go any further,
why, I&#8217;m in a position to say that I got
some plans for my future life and I don&#8217;t expect
to have any intaference with &#8217;em from my
family, or from anybody that wants to <i>join</i> my
family either. All up to now, I&#8217;ve spent my life
in a dependent position, so to speak, but after
what&#8217;s happened here lately, and knowin&#8217; all the

<h2 class="nobreak">Dorothy&#8217;s Neighbors</h2></div>

<p>A brand new comedy in four acts, by Marie Doran, author of &#8220;The New
Co-Ed,&#8221; &#8220;Tempest and Sunshine,&#8221; and many other successful plays. 4 males,
7 females. The scenes are extremely easy to arrange; two plain interiors and
one exterior, a garden, or, if necessary, the two interiors will answer. Costumes
modern. Plays 2&frac12; hours.</p>

<p>The story is about vocational training, a subject now widely discussed;
also, the distribution of large wealth.</p>

<p>Back of the comedy situation and snappy dialogue there is good logic and
a sound moral in this pretty play, which is worthy the attention of the experienced
amateur. It is a clean, wholesome play, particularly suited to
high school production.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 30 cents.</p>


<h2>Miss Somebody Else</h2>

<p>A modern play in four acts by Marion Short, author of &#8220;The Touchdown,&#8221;
etc. 6 males, 10 females. Two interior scenes. Costumes modern. Plays
2&frac14; hours.</p>

<p>This delightful comedy has gripping dramatic movements, unusual character
types, a striking and original plot and is essentially modern in theme
and treatment. The story concerns the adventures of Constance Darcy,
a multi-millionaire&#8217;s young daughter. Constance embarks on a trip to find a
young man who had been in her father&#8217;s employ and had stolen a large sum
of money. She almost succeeds, when suddenly all traces of the young man
are lost. At this point she meets some old friends who are living in almost
want and, in order to assist them through motives benevolent, she determines
to sink her own aristocratic personality in that of a refined but humble little
Irish waitress with the family that are in want. She not only carries her
scheme to success in assisting the family, but finds romance and much tense
and lively adventure during the period of her incognito, aside from capturing
the young man who had defrauded her father. The story is full of bright
comedy lines and dramatic situations and is highly recommended for amateur
production. This is one of the best comedies we have ever offered with a large
number of female characters. The dialogue is bright and the play is full of
action from start to finish; not a dull moment in it. This is a great comedy
for high schools and colleges, and the wholesome story will please the parents
and teachers. We strongly recommend it.</p>

<p class="right">Price, 30 cents.</p>


<h2>Purple and Fine Linen</h2>

<p>An exceptionally pretty comedy of Puritan New England, in three acts,
by Amita B. Fairgrieve and Helena Miller. 9 male, 5 female characters.</p>

<p>This is the Lend A Hand Smith College prize play. It is an admirable
play for amateurs, is rich in character portrayal of varied types and is not
too difficult while thoroughly pleasing.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
